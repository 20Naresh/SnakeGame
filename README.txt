Friendsâ€‘Style Snake PWA
----------------------
This is a small progressive web app (PWA) demo: a snake game with obstacles, power-ups, speed boosts,
background music (generated synth), icons, a web manifest, and a basic service worker for offline caching.

How to use:
1. Unzip the archive and serve the folder from a static web server (e.g., `npx serve .` or any hosting).
2. The app is PWA-ready; you can install it using the browser install controls.
3. Controls: arrow keys / WASD / on-screen touch buttons. Space to pause.
4. Note: Autoplay of audio may be blocked until user interacts in some browsers.

Copyright & assets:
- No copyrighted "Friends" TV show music or branded logos are included.
- The background music is a short generated loop (bg_music.wav) we created here to avoid copyright issues.
- Icons are simple stylized colored-dot icons inspired by the "friends" dots but are original art.

Files included:
- index.html, styles.css, app.js, manifest.json, sw.js, icon_192x192.png, icon_512x512.png, bg_music.wav, README.txt

Enjoy! If you'd like original song/music or logo assets included, I can guide how to add them yourself
(you must own rights or use licensed assets).
